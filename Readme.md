To run the project you'll need:
- docker/ docker-compose
- access credentials for S3 bucket

credentials_template need to be filled with AWS credentials and renamed credentials, I'm not uploading my private info for obvious reasons.

bucket name needs to be changed in main.py

To build and run interactively:

  docker-compose up --build

To run in background:

  docker-compose up --build -d
